# Getting help

The rbspy community, like the greater Ruby and Rust communities, is a helpful and welcoming place. If you need help using rbspy, here are a few options:

- The mailing list! Email rbspy-users@googlegroups.com
- Gitter chat room: http://gitter.im/rbspy/rbspy
- If you think you've found a bug, [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy/issues/new). You may want to search [open issues](https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy/issues) first, since someone else may have encountered the same bug.
