# About this profiling guide

rbspy's goal is not just to be a Ruby profiler, but to make profiling a little bit more accessible
to the Ruby community in general and something that more programmers do.

We've heard from a lot of people over the years that they find profiling confusing and that they
don't know where to start. So, this profiling guide aims to explain
some of the basics of profiling (what's benchmarking? what's a flamegraph?). Nothing in the
profiling guide is Ruby- or rbspy-specific â€” it all applies to profiling in general.
