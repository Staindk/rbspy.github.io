## Contributing

A major goal for this project is to get more maintainers and contributors. Pull requests that
improve usability, fix bugs, or help rbspy support more operating systems are very welcome. If you
have questions about contributing, come chat [on gitter](https://gitter.im/rbspy/rbspy).

The source code for rbspy is on [GitHub](https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy).

If you're not a very experienced Rust programmer, you're very welcome to contribute. A major reason
rbspy is written in Rust is that Rust is more approachable than C/C++.
https://www.rust-lang.org/ has great resources for learning Rust.
